# In conclusion Capomulin and Ramicane were the only drug regimens to show significant progress in the reduction of the tumor, but Capomulin is slightly better option. The gender of the mice does not affect the size of the tumor, both genders were tested and the average tumor size is about 40 mm3. Most mice with tumors weighted between 17-21 g, and the progression of the Capomulin drug for most mices was around every 20-30 days with an increament size of the tumor followed by a significant reduction of the tumor.
